Generates a dungeon with 5-12 rooms with a size between 3-15 in each direction.

Command line arguments are:
    -h          help
    -s          save
    -l          load
    --save      save
    --load      load

Switches preceeded by a single dash may be stacked, ig. -sl to save and load.

Currently, there are a couple bug to work out; while saves and loads are consistent,
the map generated is illegible normally, but a map is visible when inverted (as it currently is)
and so I suspect that there might be something wrong how hardness is encoded, probably
an off by one error.

Secondly, the corridor algorithm is off by one, not quite touching its end node,
and occasionally a room is left by itself.
